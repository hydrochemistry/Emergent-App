The previous AI engineer initiated the development of a graduate student research progress monitoring application, building it iteratively. It started by clarifying core requirements, then swiftly delivered an MVP including dual-role authentication (student/supervisor), task assignment, research activity logging, and an analytics dashboard, all verified by testing. Subsequent enhancements expanded functionality to include lab branding, comprehensive user profiles with file attachments, supervisor feedback on logs, a bulletin system, and a grants module. A key complex integration involved the Scopus API for publications, which was handled by a specialized  agent. The engineer diligently addressed  errors during frontend updates. The current state is mid-bug-fix: the user reported issues with profile editing, dashboard announcements, and incomplete grants/admin pages. The AI has identified a placeholder  in the frontend as a primary cause and is actively working on a comprehensive fix for the UI and related backend routes.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a comprehensive application for graduate students to monitor research progress, connect with supervisors, and log research activities. It supports dual roles (Student/Supervisor) with distinct permissions, allowing supervisors to assign and comment on tasks, and students to track progress visually. Key features include: comprehensive research activity logging (experiments, literature, data collection, meetings, writing, analysis) with duration, findings, challenges, next steps, and tagging; communication features like messaging, meeting scheduling, progress reports, attendance, and a feedback system. Enhancements include: configurable lab name and logo (via admin page), editable user profiles with photos and detailed student information (ID, program, field, enrollment, study status); supervisor meeting logs, reminders, and notes; PDF export for reports; supervisor endorsement/marks for student logs; file/picture attachments in logs; a bulletin/announcement system with supervisor/lab manager approval (supervisors can upgrade student roles to lab manager); a grants module to track current/closed grants (funder, duration, type, status, balance, PIC); and a publications module integrating with Scopus API (using supervisor ORCID/Scopus ID) to list lab papers, tagging student contributors.

- **Full-stack:** React.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
- **UI/UX:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, Glassmorphism, intuitive navigation, micro-animations.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based, dual-role (Student/Supervisor).
- **Data Handling:** PyMongo for MongoDB, Pydantic for data models.
- **APIs:** RESTful API with  prefix, Scopus API integration.
- **Environment:** Kubernetes container, Supervisor for process management.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



- ****: This is the core of the backend, a FastAPI application. It defines all API endpoints, handles user authentication (registration, login), role management, CRUD operations for tasks, research logs, supervisor meetings, grants, bulletins, and Scopus API integration. It uses PyMongo for database interactions and Pydantic for data validation. This file has been subject to multiple comprehensive rewrites to incorporate new features like lab branding, extended user profiles, grants, bulletins, and Scopus integration.
- ****: Stores sensitive environment variables such as  for database connection and a placeholder for .
- ****: The central React component that renders the entire user interface. It manages application state, handles user interactions, performs API calls to the FastAPI backend using , and renders various pages like dashboards, task lists, research log forms, user profiles, and administrative sections. This file has seen extensive modifications, including logic for dual-role views, new forms for grants and bulletins, and integration of the Scopus publication list. Recent changes focused on implementing and fixing the  and integrating new user profile fields, meeting logs, and publications display, repeatedly encountering ESLint errors.
- ****: Contains , which is crucial for the frontend to communicate with the backend API.
- ****: Defines global styles, imports Tailwind CSS layers, and sets up CSS variables for the application's theming (light/dark mode) and color palette.
- ****: This directory contains pre-built, reusable shadcn/ui components (e.g., , , , ) that are used throughout the application to ensure a consistent and modern UI.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing a bug report and implementing pending features for the Research Lab Management System. The user reported that the edit profile button is not working and that editable columns/variables are missing from the profile page. Additionally, the user requested dashboard announcements to appear as highlights, a function to register for received grants, and a comprehensive administrator page for lab details and password changes.

The AI investigated the frontend code, specifically , and identified that the  component was merely a placeholder. The AI has attempted multiple times to fix this and other related frontend issues, but encountered recurring  messages in . The last action involved rewriting  to support the new features, followed by another attempt to fix and update the frontend in  to incorporate the proper profile editing functionality, dashboard announcement display logic, and administrative features. The system is in a state where the backend might be updated, but the frontend still requires debugging and complete implementation for the reported issues.
