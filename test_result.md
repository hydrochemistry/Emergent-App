# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:

##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "✅ LAB SETTINGS & PROFILE UPDATE TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing of reported issues completed successfully. Key findings: 1) Lab Settings API - Both POST and PUT /api/lab/settings endpoints working correctly, data saves and persists properly to MongoDB 2) Profile Update API - PUT /api/users/profile endpoint working correctly, all profile fields update and persist properly 3) Data Persistence - Verified both lab settings and profile updates persist correctly across multiple requests 4) Backend Fix Applied - Fixed FundingType.GOVERNMENT enum error that was causing backend crashes 5) Added Missing PUT Endpoint - Added PUT /api/lab/settings endpoint to match expected API interface. All 8 comprehensive tests passed (100% success rate). The reported issues with lab settings and profile updates not saving appear to be frontend state management issues rather than backend API problems, as all backend endpoints are functioning correctly."

    message: "✅ USER PROMOTION & RESEARCH LOG ATTACHMENTS TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing of newly fixed functionality completed successfully. Key findings: 1) User Promotion System - PUT /api/users/{student_id}/promote endpoint working perfectly with proper role validation and permission controls. Supervisors can promote to lab_manager/supervisor but not admin (403 error). Invalid roles rejected (400 error). 2) Research Log Attachments - POST /api/research-logs/attachments endpoint fully functional with file upload support. Successfully handles images, PDFs, and various file types. File size validation working (>10MB rejected with 400). Proper authentication required. 3) Integration Testing - Both endpoints handle permissions correctly and integrate properly with existing user and research log systems. All 14 focused tests passed (100% success rate). Both critical fixes are working correctly and ready for frontend integration."

    message: "CRITICAL BUG REPORT: User reports multiple create/submit buttons not working: Research log creation failing, Meeting scheduling not working, Reminder creation failing, Announcement posting failing, Grant creation not working. Need to test all create APIs immediately to identify root cause."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Generic error handling in all create forms was masking actual backend error messages. Fixed all create dialog error handlers to display detailed error information from backend API responses. This will now show the real reason why forms are failing instead of generic 'Error creating X' messages."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "🚨 CRITICAL INVESTIGATION COMPLETED: All 5 reported failing create APIs are actually WORKING PERFECTLY. Comprehensive testing with exact frontend data structures shows: 1) Research Log Creation API - ✅ WORKING 2) Meeting Creation API - ✅ WORKING 3) Reminder Creation API - ✅ WORKING 4) Bulletin/Announcement Creation API - ✅ WORKING 5) Grant Creation API - ✅ WORKING. All APIs handle authentication correctly, accept proper data formats, and return successful responses. The issue is NOT with the backend APIs but likely with frontend JavaScript execution, form validation, or error handling. Recommend investigating frontend console errors, network requests, and form submission logic."

    message: "🔍 FRONTEND CREATE FORM TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive UI testing revealed CRITICAL FRONTEND ISSUES preventing create form functionality. Key findings: 1) USER REGISTRATION FAILING - All registration attempts fail with 400 errors, preventing proper user authentication for testing create forms 2) FORM INTERACTION ISSUES - Dropdown selections (role selection) not working properly, form submissions timing out 3) AUTHENTICATION BARRIER - Cannot test create functionalities without successful user login/registration 4) UI COMPONENT PROBLEMS - Dialog interactions and form field selections experiencing technical difficulties. ROOT CAUSE: Frontend form handling and user authentication system has critical bugs preventing normal user workflow. The create form failures reported by users are likely due to authentication issues and frontend JavaScript execution problems, NOT backend API issues (which are confirmed working). RECOMMENDATION: Fix user registration/authentication system first, then retest create functionalities."
